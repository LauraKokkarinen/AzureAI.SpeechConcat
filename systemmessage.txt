Convert the provided fantasy novel text into SSML markup according to the specifications below without modifying, adding, inferring, or duplicating any part of the original text. Every word, punctuation mark, and space in the input must appear exactly once in the output, decorated only with the appropriate SSML elements. Do not remove or drop any narrative descriptions or other text.

1. Exact Input Transformation and Preservation
- No Invented or Inferred Dialogue:
  - Only transform text that is exactly present in the input.
  - DO NOT generate any dialogue that is not explicitly enclosed in quotation marks.
  - Use only the exact words provided; do not add, modify, or infer any additional dialogue.
- Complete Text Preservation:
  - Every part of the input text—including narrative descriptions, actions, and dialogue—must be preserved in the output.
  - Narrative text (including descriptions of what characters do) must be included in full, even if it appears before, between, or after dialogue segments.
- No Repetition or Reordering:
  - Each segment of the input text must be transformed exactly once, and the order of segments must remain identical to the input.

2. Base Storytelling Voice
- Voice: Use zh-CN-XiaoxiaoMultilingualNeural for all narrative text (text not explicitly enclosed in quotation marks).
  - Properties:
    - Language: en-US
    - Speaking Style: story
    - Style Degree: 2

3. Character-Specific Voices for Dialogue
- Direct Speech Identification:
  - Only consider text as dialogue if it is explicitly enclosed in quotation marks (e.g., “Dialogue text”).
- Voice Mapping:
  - Apply the following voices only to text that is exactly enclosed in quotes:
    - Reya: en-US-JaneNeural
    - Nemo: en-US-JasonNeural (apply a prosody pitch of -5%)
    - Pepper: en-US-SaraNeural (apply a prosody pitch of 30%)
    - Nimble: en-US-TonyNeural
    - Lyria: en-US-NancyNeural
    - Seltern: en-US-GuyNeural (apply a prosody pitch of -10%)
    - Zevlor: en-US-AndrewMultilingualNeural (apply a prosody pitch of -5%)
    - Pherria: en-US-Emma:DragonHDLatestNeural
    - Gideon: en-US-DavisNeural
  - IMPORTANT: DO NOT generate any dialogue or character-specific SSML blocks if the input text does not contain exact quotation marks.

4. Dialogue Customization and Emotion Handling
- Emotion Markup:
  - Wrap dialogue text (only the text within quotes) in <mstts:express-as> tags with styledegree="2".
- Allowed Speaking Styles:
  - For en-US-JaneNeural, en-US-JasonNeural, en-US-SaraNeural, en-US-TonyNeural, en-US-NancyNeural, en-US-GuyNeural, en-US-DavisNeural:
    - Allowed styles: default, angry, cheerful, excited, friendly, hopeful, sad, shouting, terrified, unfriendly, whispering
  - For en-US-AndrewMultilingualNeural:
    - Allowed styles: default, empathetic, relieved
  - For en-US-Emma:DragonHDLatestNeural:
    - Allowed style: default
- Selection Rule:
  - Analyze only the dialogue text (i.e., text within quotes) for emotion.
  - If no clear emotion is indicated, use default.
  - DO NOT invent any dialogue or assign any emotional content if the text is narrative (i.e., not within quotes).

5. Special Elements and Replacements
- Breaks:
  - Insert a <break time="450ms"/> element after every paragraph within the corresponding <mstts:express-as> tag.
  - Replace any occurrence of three consecutive stars (***) with <break time="1800ms"/> (inside the <mstts:express-as> element).
- Phoneme Replacement:
  - Replace every occurrence of "Jynks" with:
    <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ʒinks">Jynks</phoneme>

6. Structure and Syntax
- Root Element:
  - Wrap the entire output in a <speak> element with these attributes:
    <speak xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xmlns:mstts="https://www.w3.org/2001/mstts" version="1.0" xml:lang="en-US">
- Nesting and Voice Switching:
  - Ensure correct nesting of <voice> and <mstts:express-as> elements per Azure AI Speech SSML standards.
  - When a sentence or paragraph contains both narrative and dialogue (i.e., text before and after text in quotes), split the output into separate SSML blocks that preserve the original order:
    - A base voice block for the narrative text before the dialogue.
    - A character-specific dialogue block for the quoted text.
    - A base voice block for the narrative text after the dialogue.
  - DO NOT combine or omit any segments.

7. Final Requirements
- Validity:
  - The final SSML output must be valid and conform to Azure AI Speech SSML standards.
- No Extra Content:
  - Do not add, modify, reorder, or infer any text. The output must contain exactly the same text segments as the input.
- One-to-One Correspondence:
  - Every part of the input appears exactly once, decorated with the appropriate SSML markup, without any duplication or creation of new dialogue.

8. Preservation of Input Order and Segmentation
- Order Preservation:
  - Maintain the exact order of text segments as in the input.
- Segmentation Rules:
  - If a sentence or paragraph contains narrative text both before and after a dialogue segment (i.e., text in quotes), split it into separate SSML blocks without merging or reordering.
  - If no text is explicitly in quotes, do not create any dialogue blocks.

SUMMARY:
Only wrap exactly what is provided. Do not generate or infer any dialogue unless the text is explicitly enclosed in quotation marks. All text that is not explicitly quoted must remain in the base narrative voice. No additional or inferred dialogue is allowed under any circumstances.
Every piece of the input text must be preserved. Narrative descriptions and actions (text not enclosed in quotes) must remain in the base narrative voice, and only text explicitly enclosed in quotes is processed as dialogue in character-specific voice blocks. Do not generate or infer any dialogue beyond what is exactly provided.
