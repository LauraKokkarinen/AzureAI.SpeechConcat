Convert the provided fantasy novel text into SSML markup according to the specifications below.

# Guidelines

1. **Base Storytelling Voice**:
   - Use the voice `zh-CN-XiaoxiaoMultilingualNeural` with the following properties:
     - Language: `en-US`
     - Speaking Style: `story`
     - Style Degree: `2`

2. **Character-Specific Voices for Dialogue**:
   - Assign the following voices to direct speech by characters:
     - Reya: `en-US-JaneNeural`
     - Nemo: `en-US-JasonNeural` (Add a prosody pitch of -5% for his dialogue)
     - Pepper: `en-US-SaraNeural` (Add a prosody pitch of 30% for her dialogue)
     - Nimble: `en-US-TonyNeural`
     - Lyria: `en-US-NancyNeural`
     - Seltern: `en-US-GuyNeural` (Add a prosody pitch of -10% for his dialogue)
     - Ravengard: `en-US-DavisNeural`
     - Zevlor: `en-US-AndrewMultilingualNeural` (Add a prosody pitch of -5% for his dialogue)
     - Pherria: `en-US-Emma:DragonHDLatestNeural`
   - For any characters not listed above, default to the base storytelling voice.

3. **Dialogue Customization**:
   - Use the `mstts:express-as` element inside individual `<voice>` tags to dynamically set one of the supported speaking styles below based on the context and emotion.
     - **Only use the following styles** for each of the specified voices:
       - en-US-JaneNeural, en-US-JasonNeural, en-US-SaraNeural, en-US-TonyNeural, en-US-NancyNeural, en-US-GuyNeural, en-US-DavisNeural: `default`, `angry`, `cheerful`, `excited`, `friendly`, `hopeful`, `sad`, `shouting`, `terrified`, `unfriendly`, `whispering`
       - en-US-AndrewMultilingualNeural: `default`, `empathetic`, `relieved`
       - en-US-Emma:DragonHDLatestNeural: `default`
     - The **style degree** for all speaking styles must be set to `2`.
   - Analyze the text to identify dialogue emotion and assign one of the voice styles that are listed above for the used voice. Do not assign any other style that is not explicitly listed above.

4. **Special Elements**:
   - Replace one star (*) in the text with a 500ms break (`<break time="500ms"/>`).
   - Replace two stars (**) in the text with a 1000ms break (`<break time="1000ms"/>`).
   - Replace three stars (***) in the text with a 1500ms break (`<break time="1500"/>`).
   - Replace four stars (****) in the text with a 2000ms break (`<break time="2000ms"/>`).
   - Whenever mentioning the name "Jynks", use the following phneme element: `<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ʒinks">Jynks</phoneme>`

5. **Structure and Syntax**:
   - Begin the output with `<speak>` element including properties:
     ```xml
     <speak xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xmlns:mstts="https://www.w3.org/2001/mstts"  version="1.0" xml:lang="en-US">
     ```
   - Use the **base storytelling voice** for non-dialogue text.
   - For dialogue, switch to character-specific voices and styles as applicable.
   - Return to the base storytelling voice after dialogue.
6. **Important**:
   - Do not omit any of the original text.
   - Keep the original text in the same order.
   - Do not add any text apart from the SSML markup.

# Output Format

All text must be converted into SSML markup. The final format should include:

- `<speak>` element with proper namespaces.
- `<voice>` tags for narration and character-specific dialogue.
- Proper nesting of `<mstts:express-as>` for emotional style within dialogue.
- Use `<break>` elements as specified.
- Ensure the output conforms to Azure AI Speech SSML requirements and handles emotional tone contextually.

# Notes

- Handle emotional analysis of dialogue carefully to assign the correct speaking styles.
- Changes should only involve SSML markup—do not modify, add, or remove any story content.
- If any portion of the text is unclear or ambiguous, maintain the base narration style.

# Example

Below is an example transformation of text into SSML based on the guidelines:

### Input Text:
*"The night was dark and full of terrors. 'Run!' shouted Nemo. 'We have to get away!' Pepper added, her voice trembling."*

### Output SSML:
```xml

		</prosody>
	</voice>
</speak>
```

- Reya's dialogue is marked with `cheerful` as the context suggests happiness.  
- Zevlor's dialogue includes a `<prosody>` element for pitch modification and uses `relieved` as the style to express his relief.  
- Narration uses the base storytelling voice with `story` style.  

Repeat this approach consistently for the entire text.
